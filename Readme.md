### Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** Semantic markup with proper document structure
- **CSS3:** Grid layout, Flexbox, gradients, transitions, responsive design
- **Microformats:** hCard implementation for contact information
- **JavaScript:** Basic interactivity (script.js included)

### Design Features
- Professional gradient color scheme (purple/blue theme)
- Responsive CSS Grid for team members and projects
- Hover effects and smooth transitions
- Clean, modern typography using Arial font family
- Mobile-first responsive design approach

## Problem-Solving Documentation

### Major Challenges
1. **hCard Implementation**
   - **Issue:** Understanding proper microformat structure
   - **Solution:** Studied microformats.org documentation and examples
   - **Result:** Correctly implemented vcard classes with proper nesting

2. **Image Sizing and Consistency**
   - **Issue:** Team member photos were different sizes and aspect ratios
   - **Solution:** Used CSS object-fit: cover and consistent container sizes
   - **Result:** Professional, uniform appearance across all member cards

3. **Responsive Layout**
   - **Issue:** Grid layout breaking on mobile devices
   - **Solution:** Used CSS Grid with auto-fit and minmax functions
   - **Result:** Smooth responsive behavior across all screen sizes

## Validation Results
- ✅ **HTML Validation:** All pages pass W3C HTML validator
- ✅ **CSS Validation:** Stylesheet passes W3C CSS validator  
- ✅ **Cross-browser Testing:** Confirmed compatibility in Chrome and Firefox
- ✅ **Responsive Design:** Tested on multiple screen sizes
- ✅ **hCard Validation:** Microformat structure verified

## Project Reflection
This project provided hands-on experience with fundamental web technologies. Key learning outcomes include understanding semantic HTML structure, implementing responsive CSS layouts, and working with web standards like microformats. The collaborative nature helped us learn version control and team coordination in web development.

The hCard microformat implementation was particularly educational, introducing us to the concept of semantic web and structured data that can be parsed by other applications.

## Future Improvements
- Add JavaScript interactivity for project filtering
- Implement contact form functionality
- Add animation libraries for enhanced user experience
- Include accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Add dark mode toggle option
