## Work Log  

### Day 1 - 9/24/2025
- Made all titles in content blocks the same element (h3) for easier management.

### Day 2 - 9/26/2025
- Changed title text to be same color for consistency.
- Altered some of the block colors to a darker tone for better visibility of text.
- Fixed the shade of some colors for a cleaner UI

## Challenges & Solutions  
- There were some content block titles that had h3 and others h4 randomly scattered, and I wanted to make them all the same block (h3) so that it would be easier to do CSS or style changes in the future. One challenge I encountered was the fact that there was a lot of h4 blocks and it would've taken a long time to manually change them one by one. I figured out that I could use control + shift + L to select all elements of h4 and automatically convert them, which saved me potentially an hour of redundant work.
