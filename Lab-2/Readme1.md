I worked mainly on the **JavaScript** and **front-end design**, focusing on making the page dynamic and visually engaging.

## Work Log  

### Day 1 (Setup & Structure)  
- Created the `lab2/` folder with the correct subdirectories (`resources/styles`, `resources/scripts`, `resources/images`).  
- Set up the base HTML structure and imported the Constitution text.  
- Made sure semantic HTML elements were in place for accessibility (headings, sections, articles).  

### Day 2 (Front-End Styling)  
- Designed and applied **CSS styling** for the Constitution content (fonts, spacing, color themes).  
- Added a banner image with proper attribution.  
- Focused on improving readability and navigation with consistent layouts.  

### Day 3 (JavaScript & Polishing)  
- Implemented **JavaScript** features to enhance navigation and interactivity.  
- Integrated dynamic behavior (smooth scrolling, nav bar functionality).  
- Debugged small issues in linking between `lab1` and `lab2`.  
- Final review of styling and tested on different screen sizes.

## Challenges & Solutions  
- **Challenge:** Getting relative paths to work correctly between `lab1` and `lab2`.  
  - **Solution:** Adjusted the navigation logic to use `../lab2/index.html` where needed.  
- **Challenge:** Keeping the content accessible while adding styling.  
  - **Solution:** Used semantic HTML and tested headings with a screen reader to confirm flow.
