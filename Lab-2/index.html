                <h2>The Preamble</h2>
                <div class="original-text">
                    <p>"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."</p>

                    <h3>Analysis</h3>
                    <p>The Preamble serves as the Constitution's mission statement, outlining six fundamental purposes for establishing the new government. The phrase "We the People" was revolutionary - it established that government derives its power from citizens, not from divine right or hereditary rule.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="modern-relevance">
                    <h4>Why This Matters Today</h4>
                    <p>As RPI students, you're part of "We the People." When you vote in elections, participate in peaceful protests, or engage in civic discourse on campus, you're exercising the sovereignty the Preamble establishes. The goals outlined here - justice, tranquility, defense, welfare, and liberty - remain active principles in debates about government policy, from student loan programs to free speech on campus.</p>

                <h2>History of the Constitution</h2>
                <p>The Constitution was born from necessity. After the Articles of Confederation proved too weak to govern effectively, delegates from 12 states (Rhode Island didn't attend) gathered in Philadelphia during the hot summer of 1787.</p>
                
                <p>The Constitutional Convention was supposed to merely revise the Articles of Confederation, but the delegates quickly realized they needed to start over. James Madison, often called the "Father of the Constitution," came prepared with detailed plans for a new government structure.</p>
                
                <p>Key compromises shaped our government: the Great Compromise created our bicameral legislature (House based on population, Senate with equal state representation), and the Three-Fifths Compromise addressed how enslaved people would be counted for representation purposes - a morally troubling decision that reflected the era's injustices.</p>
                
                <p>The document was signed on September 17, 1787, by 39 of the 42 delegates present. However, it still needed ratification by nine states to become law. The ratification process sparked intense debates between Federalists (who supported the Constitution) and Anti-Federalists (who feared it gave too much power to the federal government). The promise to add a Bill of Rights helped secure ratification, which was completed in 1788 when New Hampshire became the ninth state to approve it.</p>

                    <h3>Deep Dive Analysis</h3>
                    <p>Article I is the longest article because the founders saw Congress as the most important branch of government - closest to the people and holder of the "power of the purse." The enumerated powers in Section 8 establish what Congress can do, while the Necessary and Proper Clause (the "elastic clause") allows Congress to make laws needed to carry out these powers.</p>
                    <p>The bicameral structure balances representation by population (House) with equal state representation (Senate), ensuring both large and small states have meaningful voices in lawmaking.</p>

                    <h4>Impact on Your Life</h4>
                    <p>Every federal law that affects you - from student loan programs to environmental regulations to minimum wage - comes from Article I powers. When Congress debates infrastructure spending that could improve RPI's campus connectivity, or education funding that affects your tuition costs, they're exercising Article I authority. The Commerce Clause has been interpreted to allow federal regulation of everything from civil rights to internet privacy.</p>

                    <strong>Did You Know?</strong> The House was designed to be the "people's house" with 2-year terms to keep representatives close to voters, while Senators serve 6-year terms to provide stability and resist popular pressures.

                    <p><strong>Section 2:</strong> The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States... he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons... he shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties...</p>

                <div class="analysis">
                    <h3>Deep Dive Analysis</h3>
                    <p>Article II creates a single executive - a bold choice since many founders feared monarchy. The president serves as both head of state and head of government, combining ceremonial duties with executive power. The Electoral College system reflects the federal compromise, giving states a role in presidential selection rather than direct popular vote.</p>
                    <p>Executive powers include enforcement of laws, military command, diplomatic relations, and the appointment of federal judges and officials (with Senate consent for key positions).</p>

                    <h4>Impact on Your Life</h4>
                    <p>Presidential decisions affect your daily life through executive orders, agency regulations, and treaty negotiations. When the President issues student loan forgiveness programs, sets immigration policies that affect international students at RPI, or makes trade deals that impact job markets for engineering graduates, they're using Article II powers. The president's appointment of Supreme Court justices shapes constitutional interpretation for decades.</p>

                    <h3>Deep Dive Analysis</h3>
                    <p>Article III establishes federal courts and defines their jurisdiction. The Supreme Court's power of judicial review - to declare laws unconstitutional - isn't explicitly stated but was established in Marbury v. Madison (1803). Federal judges serve "during good behaviour" (essentially for life) to ensure independence from political pressure.</p>
                    <p>The judicial branch serves as a check on legislative and executive power, ensuring laws and actions comply with constitutional principles.</p>

                <div class="modern-relevance">
                    <h4>Impact on Your Life</h4>
                    <p>Federal courts protect your constitutional rights - from free speech in campus protests to due process in disciplinary hearings. Recent Supreme Court cases about student speech online, affirmative action in college admissions, and student loan forgiveness directly affect RPI students. When universities are sued over free speech policies or discrimination claims, Article III courts provide the forum for resolution.</p>

                    <strong>Did You Know?</strong> The Constitution doesn't specify the number of Supreme Court justices - it's been as few as 6 and as many as 10, settling at 9 since 1869.

                    <p>Requires states to respect each other's laws, legal decisions, and public records. The Full Faith and Credit Clause means your New York driver's license is valid in California, and the Privileges and Immunities Clause prevents states from discriminating against out-of-state residents.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Article V - The Amendment Process</h3>

                    <p>The First Amendment protects five distinct but related freedoms: religion (both establishment and free exercise), speech, press, assembly, and petition. These work together to ensure robust democratic participation and protect minority viewpoints from majoritarian suppression.</p>
                    <p>The amendment has been interpreted to protect symbolic speech, commercial speech, and even offensive speech, though with some limits (like direct incitement to violence or true threats).</p>

                    <p>Your right to join student organizations, protest university policies, publish controversial opinions in student newspapers, or practice your religion on campus all stem from the First Amendment.
