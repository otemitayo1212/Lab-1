                <h2>The Preamble</h2>
                <div class="original-text">
                    <p>"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."</p>

                    <h3>Analysis</h3>
                    <p>The Preamble serves as the Constitution's mission statement, outlining six fundamental purposes for establishing the new government. The phrase "We the People" was revolutionary - it established that government derives its power from citizens, not from divine right or hereditary rule.</p>

                    <h4>Why This Matters Today</h4>
                    <p>As RPI students, you're part of "We the People." When you vote in elections, participate in peaceful protests, or engage in civic discourse on campus, you're exercising the sovereignty the Preamble establishes. The goals outlined here - justice, tranquility, defense, welfare, and liberty - remain active principles in debates about government policy, from student loan programs to free speech on campus.</p>

                <h2>History of the Constitution</h2>
                <p>The Constitution was born from necessity. After the Articles of Confederation proved too weak to govern effectively, delegates from 12 states (Rhode Island didn't attend) gathered in Philadelphia during the hot summer of 1787.</p>
                
                <p>The Constitutional Convention was supposed to merely revise the Articles of Confederation, but the delegates quickly realized they needed to start over. James Madison, often called the "Father of the Constitution," came prepared with detailed plans for a new government structure.</p>
                
                <p>Key compromises shaped our government: the Great Compromise created our bicameral legislature (House based on population, Senate with equal state representation), and the Three-Fifths Compromise addressed how enslaved people would be counted for representation purposes - a morally troubling decision that reflected the era's injustices.</p>
                
                <p>The document was signed on September 17, 1787, by 39 of the 42 delegates present. However, it still needed ratification by nine states to become law. The ratification process sparked intense debates between Federalists (who supported the Constitution) and Anti-Federalists (who feared it gave too much power to the federal government). The promise to add a Bill of Rights helped secure ratification, which was completed in 1788 when New Hampshire became the ninth state to approve it.</p>

                    <h3>Deep Dive Analysis</h3>
                    <p>Article I is the longest article because the founders saw Congress as the most important branch of government - closest to the people and holder of the "power of the purse." The enumerated powers in Section 8 establish what Congress can do, while the Necessary and Proper Clause (the "elastic clause") allows Congress to make laws needed to carry out these powers.</p>
                    <p>The bicameral structure balances representation by population (House) with equal state representation (Senate), ensuring both large and small states have meaningful voices in lawmaking.</p>

                    <p>Every federal law that affects you - from student loan programs to environmental regulations to minimum wage - comes from Article I powers. When Congress debates infrastructure spending that could improve RPI's campus connectivity, or education funding that affects your tuition costs, they're exercising Article I authority. The Commerce Clause has been interpreted to allow federal regulation of everything from civil rights to internet privacy.</p>

                    <p>Article II creates a single executive - a bold choice since many founders feared monarchy. The president serves as both head of state and head of government, combining ceremonial duties with executive power. The Electoral College system reflects the federal compromise, giving states a role in presidential selection rather than direct popular vote.</p>
                    <p>Executive powers include enforcement of laws, military command, diplomatic relations, and the appointment of federal judges and officials (with Senate consent for key positions).</p>

When the President issues student loan forgiveness programs, sets immigration policies that affect international students at RPI, or makes trade deals that impact job markets for engineering graduates, they're using Article II powers.

                    <p>Article III establishes federal courts and defines their jurisdiction. The Supreme Court's power of judicial review - to declare laws unconstitutional - isn't explicitly stated but was established in Marbury v. Madison (1803). Federal judges serve "during good behaviour" (essentially for life) to ensure independence from political pressure.</p>
                    <p>The judicial branch serves as a check on legislative and executive power, ensuring laws and actions comply with constitutional principles.</p>

Recent Supreme Court cases about student speech online, affirmative action in college admissions, and student loan forgiveness directly affect RPI students.

                    <h3>Deep Dive Analysis</h3>
                    <p>These amendments represent the ongoing expansion of voting rights in America. The Nineteenth Amendment culminated the women's suffrage movement, the Twenty-Third addressed taxation without representation in the nation's capital, the Twenty-Fourth eliminated economic barriers to voting, and the Twenty-Sixth responded to the "old enough to fight, old enough to vote" argument during the Vietnam War.</p>
                    <p>Together, they demonstrate the Constitution's capacity to evolve toward greater political inclusion, though voting rights remain contested terrain.</p>

                    <h4>Digital Age Implications</h4>
                    <p>These voting rights amendments intersect with digital democracy in important ways. Online voter registration must accommodate these protected classes without creating new barriers. Digital political engagement has particularly empowered young voters (protected by the 26th) and women (protected by the 19th). As voting moves increasingly online, ensuring these constitutional protections extend to digital voting systems is crucial.</p>

                    <strong>Did You Know?</strong> The Twenty-Sixth Amendment was ratified in just over three months - the fastest in constitutional history - reflecting broad consensus about the voting age during the Vietnam War era.

                    <h3>Deep Dive Analysis</h3>
                    <p>These "government operations" amendments refine the constitutional framework established in Articles I and II. They address practical problems that emerged over time: lengthy transitions between elections and inaugurations (20th), the tradition of presidential term limits becoming constitutional law (22nd), clarifying presidential succession (25th), and creating a check on congressional self-dealing (27th).</p>
                    <p>The Twenty-Seventh Amendment has the unique distinction of being proposed in 1789 but not ratified until 1992, demonstrating that proposed amendments don't expire.</p>

                    <h4>Digital Age Implications</h4>
                    <p>In our digital era, these amendments take on new significance. The Twenty-Fifth Amendment's disability provisions must account for situations where a president might be temporarily incapacitated but could quickly resume duties. The Twentieth Amendment's shortened transition period is more challenging in an age where national security threats can emerge instantly online. Digital transparency makes enforcement of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment more visible to the public.</p>

                    <strong>Did You Know?</strong> The Twenty-Seventh Amendment was originally proposed by James Madison as part of the Bill of Rights but wasn't ratified until 1992, after a college student discovered it was still pending and organized a ratification campaign.
